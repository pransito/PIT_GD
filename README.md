# PIT_GD
Scripts related to my PhD project "PIT in Gambling Disorder"

Holds scripts for my main PhD project regardless of programming language. Used to be called "PDT".

For behavioral data it holds the import_data.R script. The actual analyses are in the PIT_GD_behav_release and PIT_GD_MRI_release repos.

Added now also MRI analysis scripts and the scripts to handle the peripheral physiological data.
